# Online Food Ordering System

an web based application where people can order food sitting at home. they can see the food item list, select quantities and confirm the order by giving address details. also they can select payment method, give a ticket tag and edit their user details if needed.
From the admin end all the pending orders, cancelled orders, available food items will be seen. admin can update the food price as well.

project status: in progress

bugs: functional defect. for example, after address submission it again ask for address.

future plan: create an option by which the customers will be able to track orders.
